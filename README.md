# AroundTheBlock:
Blockchain Ponderings: An accumulation of blockchain knowledge and perspectives - [@aroundblocks](https://twitter.com/AroundBlocks) on twitter

This is a collection my thoughts and perspectives on the blockchain from both a technical, societal and business perspective.  The sections herin may provide the basis for work I aim to do in the future e.g. 

* Distrubuted application development on the blockchain
* Blockchain consulting
* Presenting blockchain to the uninitiated

This git-hub repo will be used as a convenient place to collect, format and arrange my thoughts.  The contents may form the basis for creating slides or even turning into a book, but the primary aim os personal - to solidify my understanding and think about how best to position blockchain technologies to other people.

## Sections:

### Whence Came Blockchain
* [Section1: Society and Rules](https://github.com/JohnD-EE/AroundTheBlock/blob/master/WhenceCameBlockchain/Section1:SocietyAndRules.md)
