# Overcoming Objections to Bitcoin and Blockchain

### Governments will probably ban it 

### It's a Ponzi Scheme / Fraud / Scam

### Quantum computing will destroy it

### It's just for speculators who hoarde, and don't spend

### It's for crime, drug dealing, prostitution, terrorism, money laundering, ransomware.

### It's not intrinsically worth anything

### bitcoin miners consume the same electricity the whole of Ireland

### It takes too long to sync the blockchain

### It's too difficult for ordinary users

### It can't scale - Visa averages 2,000 transactions per second compared to bitcoin's 7 per second
