# Society and Rules

## Aims
This section looks at: 
* How rules are developed, applied and enforced within societies.
* Introducing the concept of 'governence' as the application of rules.
* How consistently good governence leads to trust
* How our need for governence had led to centralisation

## Rules

### Human Interactions:
Humans interact with one another. The are informal interactions of family and friendship, sharing and socialising. There are also more formal interactions such as organising as a group to accomplish a task, or trading with one another. An interaction is seen as informal or formal according the 'rules' that govern the interactions.  Informal interactions will have a very loose set of rules, and these will be determined by culture and tradition.  There are certain dos and don'ts associated with informal interactions rather than hard-coded rules.  They are implicitly understood and adhered to by the parties involved and these loose rules will change according to the situation. A transgression, such as burping at dinner, may see you having fewer lunch dates, rather than any more of serious repercussions.

Our formal interactions with one another involve hard-coded rules to govern our behaviours.  The rules are enforced, by a tribal leader or council, or by the latter day equivalents of governments, courts and police. Transgression of rules can lead forced reconstitution such as revenge, punishment, ostracism from the tribe or group, imprisonment, extraction of property etc.  In the modern day it can be withdrawal of rights, payment of penalties...

We look to central authorities to set the and uphold the rules.  Through statue and through the evolution of law through legal precedents enforcible by our criminal justice systems

We also develop abstract ideas of order, such as human rights and freedom of speech.  These are abstract concepts and ideas which have been adopted in the west into the codified law and culture of the society.  Breaches of these rules are dealt with by the central authority of the government.

Our societies have developed through periods of theocracy,feudalism and the absolutism of monarchies, endured totalitarian governments, fascism and communism.  We have developed sophisticated forms of democracy where the aim is for our government to be of the people, for the people and by the people.

There are differences of opinion on what the role of a central government should be.

Laissez faire, social redistribution of wealth / inequality, .....   Openness and accountability.  Trusfull, not lying...

### Trust
The government is an entity in which people truest 

We also place our trust in institutions, companies and organisations. They have a reputation earned from past actions, and fight to maintain that trust through their everyday actions.  These organisations are also centralised.  They have a central HQ and a centralised datacenter.  They may have regional outlets but the decisions are taken by a central board of managers and directors.   They lay down rules of how they will operate and they ensure they comply with rules laid down by external bodies such as governments and regulatory bodies. Managing the adherence to rules is governance. Good governance creates reliable operations.  It builds and maintains the necessary trust in order to be successful in the marketplace. Trust is everything in a market economy.  If trust is betrayed, people will exercise their free will and choose an alternative. People trust strong, centralised institutions with good governance.

Liberal (e.g. Western) democracy is held up as the pinnacle of human civilisation.  It is often portrayed as the be all and end all of political organisation.  Countries using other political systems are looked down upon, and democracy has been exported, with dubious results, as a replacement to more 'archaic' systems.
