## Blockchain Intro
* Bitcoin was introduced with the aim of 'revolutionising currency'
* It was built on a technology called 'Blockchain'
* In recent years, people have focused on Blockchain as being potentially more revolutionary than bitcoin
* To understand the domain the following will be covered:
    * What is money?
    * Why does currecny need a rovultion?
    * What is Bitcoin and how does it work?
    * What is the Blockchain?
    * Why is the Blockhain considered 'revolutionary'?

## History of Money

* Barter
* Cowry Shells / Beads / Giant Stones / Tally Sticks / Precious Metals
* Tokenised Barter, a representation of value
* Anglo-Saxon Pound of Silver - Sterling
* 17th Century Goldsmith Banking - Birth of Modern Banking
* International Gold Standard, convertabily to gold - 1874 - 1914
* WW1 and 1929 Crash = indebtedness & instability - Gold Standard abandoned UK in 1931, USA in 1933
* Fiat Currency (By order of the State) - Latin = fieri, "an arbitrary act or decree"
* Value of fiat solely from government decree dictating legal tender



## Fractional Reserve Banking

* Your deposit is a 'loan' to the bank
* Reserve requiremnt / Reserve Ratio - fraction of its deposit liabilities (money owed to depositors)
* Held as currency or as central bank deposits
* Multiplier effect
* All Money is Debt - If all debts were paid there would be no money
* Money created through private bank lending and govt. issuance
* High cost of banking - buildings, infrastructure, staff, transactions

> *"Gold Is Money, Everything Else Is Credit"* - JP Morgan



## Systemic Vulnerabilities

* Over lending - E.g. Sub Prime Mortgages
* Bank Runs (Royal Bank of Scotland)
* Bailouts - 'Too big to fail' (Privatisation of Profits, Socialisation of risk)
* Fraud, corruption and bank scandals (Libor, PPI)
* Quantitative Easing
* Inflation and Hyperinflation
* UK Debt = £1.7 Trillion, nearly £1 Billion per week in interest
* Economic addiction to GDP growth
* Stability requires intervention from Govt. & Central Banks

> *"No return to boom and bust"* - Gordon Brown, British Prime Minister, pre-2008 crash

> *"Banks 'very much stronger'; another financial crisis not likely 'in our lifetime'"* - Janet Yellen, Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, June 2017



## Bitcoin

* No Bitcoin CEO, No Bitcoin buildings or HQ, no central authority
* Distributed and immutable public ledger
* Peer to Peer, processing transactions via mining nodes - no need for intermediaries such as financial institutions.
* Decentralised Trust - Trustless Transactions
* Open Source codebase - [Bitcoin on Github](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin)
* Truth is in the public ledger & network consensus.
* Free Market, Capitalism, no intervention
* Responsibility with user - you are your own bank - Private / Public key pairs
* Evolution through voting (e.g. Segwit)

## Bitcoin Comparison to Other Currencies

| | Fiat Currency | Bitcoin | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Governance & Control | Centralised | Decentralised |
| Money Supply | Determined by the State & Prvate Banks | Known and Scheduled at Coin Genesis |
| Accessibility | Participation requires a bank account | Anyone can easily create an account |
| Fees | Bank account fees and costly transfers | Zero account fees, low transaction costs |
| Privacy | Bank accounts linked to personal identities | Anonymous |
| Transparency | Accounts & transactions are private | Account and transaction activity is public |
| Ease of Tranfer | Can be cumbersome (cheques, international transfers) | Easy |
| Transaction Speed | Slow to clear | Clears within minutes |
| Security | Fraud is common | Immutable ledger, but you may personally be hacked |
| Protection | Government protection available | You are solely responsible |
| Repudiation |   | Depends upon recipient |
| Ownership | Your deposit is a loan to the bank (a liability in their accounts) | You have full ownership |

## Asset Classes

* Stocks & Shares (equities)
* Fixed Income (bonds)
* Cash
* FX - Foreign Exchange (currencies)
* Real Estate (land & property)
* Commodoites (Physical Stuff - gold, silver, oil, wheat, corn)
* Cryptocurrecnies as a new asset class?

## Functions of Money

* Medium of exchange
* Store of value
* Unit of account / Means of valuation - information about relative values
* Standard of deferred payment

## Characteristics of Money

* Durability
* Portability
* Divisibility
* Uniformity / Fungibility

* Acceptibility / Good History of Acceptance
* Un-consumable

> A cow or oil is an asset, but could not be classed as money because they do not satisfy the above criteria 


## Cryptocurrency Account Storage

* Local (desktop) Wallet. Lightweight, or Full Node
* Mobile Wallet
* Browser Extensions (e.g. Metamask)
* Online Web Wallet - e.g. Crypto Exchange
* Paper (Offline Cold Storage)
* USB or other device (Offline Cold Storage)
* Hardware Wallet (Offline Cold Storage - E.g. Trezor / Ledger Nano)
* Your Memory (Offline, Very Cold Storage)

## What is a Wallet?

* Software which reads information from the blockchain and 'key storage' account files
* Does not store coins or account balance
* Account details, balances, transactions and currency prices are shown in the UI
* The account balance is read from blockchain files
* The wallet software allows the initiation of transactions
* wallet.dat file for 'Bitcoin Core' wallets. Stores public/private keypairs for each account address as well as transactions. Each wallet.dat file can contain multiple accounts
* Ethereum Geth wallets store accounts as individual timestamped files, one per account. Balance and transaction info is read from the blockchain.  No transaction data is held in the account files.

## Blockchain Transactions

* Inputs and Outputs
* Transaction Fees
* Mining
* Consensus
* Confirmations

## Bitcoin Transactions

* Inputs and Outputs
   * UTXO - The balance of a bitcoin address is the unspent Transaction Outputs pointing to that address. Outputs from other transactions pointing to a given address. UTXO = curl https://blockchain.info/unspent?active=1JCe8z4jJVNXSjohjM4i9Hh813dLCNx2Sy 
   * Bitcoin is analogous to how cash moves around a system, rather than balances in a bank account
   * There is no balance held on the blockchain, the balance for an account (e.g. address) is *derived* from the UTXOs
* New transaction: 
   * Built from one or more inputs (outputs from previous transactions)  . e.g. composed of loose change
   * The output(s) of this transactions are inputs into target address. 
   * The bitcoin wallet software would reference UTXOs from previous transactions as intputs into the new transaction
   * Encumberance (need to be digital singed by target address in order to be respent)
   * If inputs are larger than transaction size then an output is generated to return payment back to sending address
* Communicating & processing the new transaction
    * The transaction is communicated to a node the sender is connected to and quickly propegated to other nodes
    * Misconception that we must wait 10 mins for transaction to be processed (mined)
    * Recipient wallet can verify that the transaction is well formed of UTXO
    * If tranasction is very small then retaier could confidently accept it as a valid transaction without waiting for confirmations with little risk.
* Every transaction costs a fee. This is variable and can be set by the transaction initiator. A higher fee increases the likelihood of faster processing by the miners. 

## Bitcoin Mining

*
* A new transaction is communicated to the Bitcoin network nodes
* A temporary list of unverified transactions, maintained by all nodes
* A miner builds a new block built from unverified transactions list, highest fees first
* In addition to the transactions, a 'header' is created which contains the hash (e.g. fingerprint) of the previous block 
* The miner also adds his reward to the list of transactions (new bitcoins are created in the mining process in the form of a reward to the successful miner.
* The miner calculates the proof of work for this block
* The first miner to complete the calculation is the winner and has the privilege of adding the block to the chain and collecting a mining reward
