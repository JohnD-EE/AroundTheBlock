* Anglo-Saxon Pound of Silver - Sterling
* 17th Century Goldsmith Banking - Birth of Modern Banking
* International Gold Standard, convertabily to gold - 1874 - 1914

* Fiat Currency (By order of the State) - Latin = fieri, "an arbitrary act or decree"
* Value of fiat solely from government decree dictating legal tender


## Fractional Reserve Banking

* Your deposit is a 'loan' to the bank
* Reserve requiremnt / Reserve Ratio - fraction of its deposit liabilities (money owed to depositors)
* Held as currency or as central bank deposits
* Multiplier effect
* All Money is Debt - If all debts were paid there would be no money
* Money created through private bank lending and govt. issuance
* High cost of banking - buildings, infrastructure, staff, transactions

> *"Gold Is Money, Everything Else Is Credit"* - JP Morgan

## Systemic Vulnerabilities

* Over lending - E.g. Sub Prime Mortgages
* Bank Runs (Royal Bank of Scotland)
* Bailouts - 'Too big to fail' (Privatisation of Profits, Socialisation of risk)
* Fraud, corruption and bank scandals (Libor, PPI)
* Quantitative Easing
* Inflation and Hyperinflation
* UK Debt = £1.7 Trillion, nearly £1 Billion per week in interest
* Economic addiction to GDP growth
* Stability requires intervention from Govt. & Central Banks

> *"No return to boom and bust"* - Gordon Brown, British Prime Minister, pre-2008 crash

> *"Banks 'very much stronger'; another financial crisis not likely 'in our lifetime'"* - Janet Yellen, Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, June 2017

## Bitcoin

* No Bitcoin CEO, No Bitcoin buildings or HQ, no central authority
* Distributed and immutable public ledger
* Peer to Peer, processing transactions via mining nodes - no need for intermediaries such as financial institutions.
* Trust in the Open Source codebase - [Bitcoin on Github](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin)
* Truth is in the public ledger & network consensus.
* Free Market, Capitalism, no intervention
* Responsibility with user - you are your own bank - Private / Public key pairs
* Evolution through voting (e.g. Segwit)

## History of Bitcoin
