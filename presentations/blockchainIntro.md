# Blockchain Intro


### Agenda



## Centralised / Decentralised / Distributed

* Trust
* Control
* Truth
* Security
* Privacy
* Single Point of Failure (Datacenter)

## Money

* Centralised
* Government
* Banks
* Trust, Conntrol, Truth, Security

## History of Money

* Barter
* Cowry Shells / Beads / Giant Stones / Tally Sticks / Precious Metals
* Tokenised Barter, a representation of value
* Anglo-Saxon Pound of Silver - Sterling
* 17th Century Goldsmith Banking - Birth of Modern Banking
* International Gold Standard, convertabily to gold - 1874 - 1914
* WW1 and 1929 Crash = indebtedness & instability - Gold Standard abandoned UK in 1931, USA in 1933
* Fiat Currency (By order of the State) - Latin = fieri, "an arbitrary act or decree"
* Value of fiat solely from government decree dictating legal tender


## Fractional Reserve Banking

* Your deposit is a 'loan' to the bank
* Reserve requiremnt / Reserve Ratio - fraction of its deposit liabilities (money owed to depositors)
* Held as currency or as central bank deposits
* Multiplier effect
* All Money is Debt - If all debts were paid there would be no money
* Money created through private bank lending and govt. issuance
* High cost of banking - buildings, infrastructure, staff, transactions

## Systemic Vulnerabilities

* Over lending - E.g. Sub Prime Mortgages
* Bank Runs (Royal Bank of Scotland)
* Bailouts - 'Too big to fail' (Privatisation of Profits, Socialisation of risk)
* Fraud, corruption and bank scandals (Libor, PPI)
* Quantitative Easing
* Inflation and Hyperinflation
* UK Debt = £1.7 Trillion, nearly £1 Billion per week in interest
* Economic addiction to GDP growth
* Stability requires intervention from Govt. & Central Banks

## Bitcoin

* No Bitcoin CEO, No Bitcoin buildings or HQ, no central control
* Distributed public ledger
* Peer to Peer, processing transactions via mining nodes.
* Trust in the Open Source codebase
* Truth is in the public ledger & network consensus.
* Free Market, Capitalism, no intervention
* Responsibility with user - you are your own bank - Private / Public key pairs
* Evolution through voting (e.g. Segwit)

## History of Bitcoin

* Cypherpunks & cryptography
* Satoshi Nakamoto White Paper, bitcoin and blockchain
* 10,000 bitcoin Pizzas
* Other Cryptocurrencies, AltCoins, Bitcoin Forks [Historical Snapshot 7th July 2013](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20130707/)
* Etc...
* MtGox
* Other uses of blockchain
* Vitalek Buterin and Ethereum

## Bitcoin Mechanics

* Account is a Hashed address - Private / Public Key Pairs -  QR Codes
* Wallets - Full Node, Light, Online, Paper
* Buying bitcoin
* Legalities

* Mining & Proof of Work
* Finding a Hash - SHA256 256 bit string - Brute Force
* One Block every 10 minutes, 144 per day, 
* Difficulty Calibration
* Mining Pools and Hash Rate
* Consensus, Confirmations and Block Depth / Height
* 51% Attack

## Bitcoin Price

* Determined by Markets
* Uncertainty & Volatility
