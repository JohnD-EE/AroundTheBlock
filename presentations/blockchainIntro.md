# Blockchain Intro


### Agenda



## Centralised / Decentralised / Distributed

* Trust
* Control
* Truth
* Security
* Privacy
* Single Point of Failure (Datacenter)

## Money

* Government
* Banks
* Trust, Conntrol, Truth, Security

## Money

* Tokenised Barter
* Cowry Shells / Beads / Giant Stones / Tally Sticks / Precious Metals

## Fractional Reserve Banking

* Mining & Proof of Work
* Finding a Hash - SHA256 256 bit string - Brute Force
* Difficulty Calibration
* Mining Pools and Hash Rate
* Consensus and Block Depth 
* 51% Attack
