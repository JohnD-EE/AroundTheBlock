### Ethereum


## Ethereum History

* Vitalek Buterin - White Paper
* Gavin Wood
* Smart Contracts, State
* Ethereum Foundation
* EVM

## Ethereum as a Wold Computer

* EVM Ethereum Virtual Machine
* Single Processer (no multi-threading)
* Anyone can upload & execute programs
* Each Program has its own permanent storage that persists between executions
* The EVM can't be turned off

## Ethereum as an internet service platform for guaranteed computation

* User authentication, via seamless integration of cryptographic signatures
* Fully customizable payment logic, no reliance on third parties
* 100% ddos resistant up-time
* No-fuss secure torage
* Ultimate interoperability. Everything in the ecosystem interacts with everything else
* Server free zone: Do not need to set up and maintain servers, let your users pay for service the use.

## Ethereum Milestone Phases

* Frontier - Initial Release 2105, Ether Token, CLI for mining, contracts deploy and execute.
    * Tagline: "A safe decentralized software platform", with the word "safe" crossed out
* Homestead - Stable and tested, but still in beta
    * Tagline: "safe" no longer crossed out
* Metropolis - Ethereum for the masses, easy UX
* Serenity - PoW to PoS


## Ethereum Whisper - Shh!:

* Dapps messaging each other - P2P comms - RTC (real time comms)
* Unicast (encrypted to identity) / Broadcast (encrypted to topic) / Multicast
* Dapps signalling to collaborate on transactions
* Transient Datagrams - broadcst a message between groups of ppl that have a limited lifetime
* Dark comms (privacy) where correspondents know nothing about each other except a hash. Hide location of sender and receiver (via a system of location obfuscation relays).
* shh protocol
* Messaging doesn't need consensus and is expensive to be processed on blockchain - needs dedicated protocol
* Ethereum nodes perform a routing function, passing on the message
* Not high-bandwidth point-to-point so can't be like skype
