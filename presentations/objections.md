# Overcoming Objections to Bitcoin and Blockchain

Intro:
We are pleasure seeking, pain avoiding creatures. Driven by emotions, a slave to our passions.  Our intellect, our seat of reason is rarely engaged in our everyday lives, or at least not as much as we tend to think. We kid ourselves that we are mainly rational beings, and distance ourselves from the savage, territorial attributes of the anumal kingdom. Our inner beast.  But the key to our very survival has been our animalistic drives to dominance etc...

Slaves to our natural instincts 

Fear, Pride, envy, love, hatred, empathy, pity, disgust, regret, anger, sorrow, joy, anxiety, neurosis, contempt, guilt, shame, disdain, awe, terror, ecstacy, rage, desire, love, greed...

Why would somebody be motivated to object to technology?


##Non-malicious objections:

Indifference and lack of knowledege:
1) They are largely indifferent, they don't have any particular emotions towards it, they've not been motivated to understand it. We have so many things to pay attention to that we have to filter all the noise.  If we've heard that bitcoin isn't worth paying attention to because someone in authority, such as a CEO of a bank, or government figure, has called it out as a 'fraud' then we'll use that as a heuristc to decide it's not worth paying attention to.

Just plain stupid:
Some people are just too stupid to event want to gain knowledge

## Malicious onjections

Envy & Regret:
2) They know about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and regret they didn't buy into it earlier. They feel regret and envy. Their fragile ego is dented. Their place in the worldwide social domainance hierarchy is diminished slightly and they depressed if they reflect on it. As a defence mechanism, they may justify their poor judgement with reasons, offering objections against the technology as a way to protect their ego. Anything to avoid feeling inferior to those who got in early. They ay feel resentment and anger towards those who became rich through early adoption and attribute negative attributes to them.

Fear:
3) We are highly conditioned to the status quo, many people see change as a threat. Bitcoin and blockchain technology threatens institutions in which many people see as an authority and willingly place their trust. Stable and 'rock solid' entities such as banks and governments are threatened, thus leading to anxiety and a fear of cataclismic change. People may see the very fabric of society, into which they have invested their core values, as being under threat.

Intimidation:
4) The technology, the buzzwords and cliquiness around bitcoin and blockchain may be intimidating to some. It requires a degree of effort and motivation to understand it. They may try to hide their intimidation or laziness by attacking the technology or its uses. There is no shortage of scare stories or negative claims to refer to in order to cover up the frustration of a lack of understanding.

Intellectual bigotry:
5) Some people always want to win the argument. Even physically weak people can play at being alpha male through intellectual intimidation if blessed with the intellectual capcity and motivation to understand and vocalise complex subject matter. A sharp tongue combined with a sharp brain can be used to construct logically valid argments which due to their well constructed form, and  

Social Dominance:
6) The relative position of counterparties in the social dominance hierarchy will dramatically shape the argument. Those with higher social status will always have an advantage, unless they deliberately shape the context the discussion to encourage an unencumbered exchange of rational arguments.

People will defend their prejudices

### Governments will probably ban it, making you a criminal if you have bitcoins
Evidence: 
List countries who have banned it, controversies such as china.  
Also look at where govt have embraced crypto / blockchain.
Look at regulation of eco-system - ICOs and Exchanges, Darkweb and crime
Look at motivations for a ban, is govt threatened. How can govt functions be theatened?  What are the use cases in govt.

### It's a Ponzi Scheme / Fraud / Scam

### No-one is in control of it, no-one knows who actually started it, and it isn't supported by government

### What if you lose your bitcoins, or get hacked?

### It's just software, what if there is a bug?

### The 51% attack

### Quantum computing will destroy it

### It's just for speculators who hoarde, you can't spend it anywhere

### The market is too volatile, retailers won't accept it, they want a certain price

### It's for crime, drug dealing, prostitution, terrorism, money laundering, ransomware.

### It's not intrinsically worth anything, it isn't backed by anything

### bitcoin miners consume the same electricity the whole of Ireland

### It takes too long to sync the blockchain

### It's too difficult for ordinary users

### It can't scale - Visa averages 2,000 transactions per second compared to bitcoin's 7 per second

### It's too expensive now to buy a bitcoin

### There are 7 billion people in the world but only 21 million bitcoin will ever be produced

### It's too late to buy into bitcoin now, it will just make the people who got in early even richer

### The exchanges can get hacked

### It's too difficult to buy bitcoin in the first place

### It's a bit cultish

### Childish 'speculators' talking about coins mooning and buying lambos

### Pump and dumpers, rigging markets, causing price volatility

### What if Satoshi Nakamoto suddenly sells all the coins he owns?

### Someone can see how much is in your account and brute force crack your private key

### The could be a hash collision where two people have the same address and can spend each others coins

### Big mining pools and exchanges are centralised authorities, bitcoin is supposed to be decentralised

### It's not a good store of value
