# Overcoming Objections to Bitcoin and Blockchain

Intro:
We are pleasure seeking, pain avoiding creatures. Driven by emotions, a slave to our passions.  Our intellect, our seat of reason is rarely engaged in our everyday lives, or at least not as much as we tend to think. We kid ourselves that we are mainly rational beings, and distance ourselves from the savage, territorial attributes of the anumal kingdom. Our inner beast.  But the key to our very survival has been our animalistic drives to dominance etc...

Slaves to our natural instincts 

Fear, Pride, envy, love, hatred, empathy, pity, disgust, regret, anger, sorrow, joy, anxiety, neurosis, contempt, guilt, shame, disdain, awe, terror, ecstacy, rage, desire, love, greed...

### Governments will probably ban it, making you a criminal if you have bitcoins

### It's a Ponzi Scheme / Fraud / Scam

### No-one is in control of it, no-one knows who actually started it, and it isn't supported by government

### What if you lose your bitcoins, or get hacked?

### It's just software, what if there is a bug?

### The 51% attack

### Quantum computing will destroy it

### It's just for speculators who hoarde, you can't spend it anywhere

### The market is too volatile, retailers won't accept it, they want a certain price

### It's for crime, drug dealing, prostitution, terrorism, money laundering, ransomware.

### It's not intrinsically worth anything, it isn't backed by anything

### bitcoin miners consume the same electricity the whole of Ireland

### It takes too long to sync the blockchain

### It's too difficult for ordinary users

### It can't scale - Visa averages 2,000 transactions per second compared to bitcoin's 7 per second

### It's too expensive now to buy a bitcoin

### There are 7 billion people in the world but only 21 million bitcoin will ever be produced

### It's too late to buy into bitcoin now, it will just make the people who got in early even richer

### The exchanges can get hacked

### It's too difficult to buy bitcoin in the first place

### It's a bit cultish

### Childish 'speculators' talking about coins mooning and buying lambos

### Pump and dumpers, rigging markets, causing price volatility

### What if Satoshi Nakamoto suddenly sells all the coins he owns?

### Someone can see how much is in your account and brute force crack your private key

### The could be a hash collision where two people have the same address and can spend each others coins

### Big mining pools and exchanges are centralised authorities, bitcoin is supposed to be decentralised

### It's not a good store of value
