# Overcoming Objections to Bitcoin and Blockchain

### Governments will probably ban it, making you a criminal if you have bitcoins

### It's a Ponzi Scheme / Fraud / Scam

### No-one is in control of it, no-one knows who actually started it, and it isn't supported by government

### What if you lose your bitcoins, or get hacked?

### It's just software, what if there is a bug?

### The 51% attack

### Quantum computing will destroy it

### It's just for speculators who hoarde, you can't spend it anywhere

### The market is too volatile, retailers won't accept it, they want a certain price

### It's for crime, drug dealing, prostitution, terrorism, money laundering, ransomware.

### It's not intrinsically worth anything, it isn't backed by anything

### bitcoin miners consume the same electricity the whole of Ireland

### It takes too long to sync the blockchain

### It's too difficult for ordinary users

### It can't scale - Visa averages 2,000 transactions per second compared to bitcoin's 7 per second

### It's too expensive now to buy a bitcoin

### There are 7 billion people in the world but only 21 million bitcoin will ever be produced

### It's too late to buy into bitcoin now, it will just make the people who got in early even richer

### The exchanges can get hacked

### It's too difficult to buy bitcoin in the first place

### It's a bit cultish

### Childish 'speculators' talking about coins mooning and buying lambos

### Pump and dumpers, rigging markets, causing price volatility

### What if Satoshi Nakamoto suddenly sells all the coins he owns?

### Someone can see how much is in your account and brute force crack your private key

### The could be a hash collision where two people have the same address and can spend each others coins

### Big mining pools and exchanges are centralised authorities, bitcoin is supposed to be decentralised

### It's not a good store of value
